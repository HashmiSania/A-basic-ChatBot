# A-basic-ChatBot
## Overview
Chatpatbot is a simple yet effective conversational AI bot developed using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It simulates human-like interaction by responding to user queries with relevant and contextually appropriate answers. The bot uses NLP methods to process and understand user input, making it a valuable tool for basic information retrieval and interaction.

## Key Features
##### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Implements tokenization and lemmatization to preprocess and understand user inputs.
##### TF-IDF Vectorization:
Utilizes Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to convert textual data into numerical form, enabling the bot to identify the most relevant responses.
##### Cosine Similarity:
Measures the similarity between the user’s query and the bot’s knowledge base, ensuring accurate and meaningful responses.
##### Greeting Detection:
Recognizes and responds to common greetings with friendly, predefined responses.
##### Error Handling:
Includes fallback responses for unrecognized inputs, enhancing the bot's ability to handle a wide range of queries.
## How It Works
##### Input Processing:
The bot first tokenizes the user's input and then normalizes it by removing punctuation and lemmatizing the words.
##### Response Generation:
The input is compared with the bot’s knowledge base using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to generate the most relevant response.
##### User Interaction:
The bot continues to interact with the user until the user decides to end the conversation.
